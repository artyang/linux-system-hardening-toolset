# linux-system-hardening-toolset
# This is a set of useful scripts in Bash and Python which are used for security hardening of a linux distribution.
# This will expand into forensics and memory utilities.   This was rapidly built with the assistance of generative AI as an experiment on the usefulness of AI assisted programming.
#
# This is distributed free and opensource using the MIT License.
# 
# Goals: built in tools or distribution defaults of a linux system.  
# -Should not contain specialized libraries or packages outside of the default installation
# -If a utility has multiple implmentations across platforms - the utility should check for which command is installed.
# -It should automate some manual task that is normally executed by hand.
# -It should solve, in some way, a security, system admin, forensics, or networking problem.
# Some scripts may require some mofification (i.e. usernames or file input).  Always advisable that you read the code before you execute.
