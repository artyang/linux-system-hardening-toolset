# Goals: built in tools or distribution defaults of a linux system.  
# -Should not contain specialized libraries or packages outside of the default installation
# -If a utility has multiple implmentations across platforms - the utility should check for which command is installed.
#
# Some scripts may require some mofification (i.e. usernames or file input).  Always advisable that you read the code before you execute.
